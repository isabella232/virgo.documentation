	<title>Deploying Applications</title>
	<para>
		Currently the Tools support direct deployment of WTP Dynamic Web Projects, OSGi
		bundle and PAR projects to the @tomcat.product.name.short@ from
		directly within Eclipse.
	</para>
	<para>
		To deploy an application to the @tomcat.product.name@ just bring up the
		context menu on the configured
		@tomcat.product.name.short@ runtime in the Servers view and choose "Add or Remove Projects...".
		In the
		dialog, select the desired project and add it to the list of "Configured
		projects".
	</para>

	<note>
		<para>
			Deploying and undeploying an application from the @tomcat.product.name.short@
			certainly works
			while the @tomcat.product.name@ is running, but you can also add or remove
			projects if the
			@tomcat.product.name.short@ is not running.
		</para>
	</note>
	<para>
		Once an application is deployed on the @tomcat.product.name@ the tooling
		support will automatically
		pick up any change to source files -- for example, Java and XML context
		files -- and refresh the
		deployed application on the @tomcat.product.name.short@.
	</para>
	<para>
		The wait time between a change and the actual refresh can be configured
		in the configuration editor of the runtime. To bring up that editor,
		double-click on the configured @tomcat.product.name@ instance in the
		Servers view.
	</para>
