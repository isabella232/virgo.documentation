	<title>Known Issues</title>

	<para>This section describes known issues that you might run into, along with corresponding workarounds.  </para>

	<para>For the full list of known issues, see <ulink url="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced;order=Importance;classification=RT;product=Virgo">Virgo bugs in Eclipse Bugzilla</ulink>.  The bugs are organised by component as well as by release.  You can also use bugzilla to enter a new issue if you cannot find an existing issue that describes the problem you are running into, but it's probably worth asking on the <ulink url="http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=thread&amp;frm_id=159">Virgo community forum</ulink> first.</para>

	<section id="known-issues-firewall-timeout">
		<title>Timeout During Startup Due to Firewall Settings</title>
		<para>
			The @short.product.name@ will fail to start correctly if it is prevented from 
			connecting to needed ports by the firewall. Typically this manifests 
			as error <literal>SPPM0003E</literal> . Configuring the firewall to
			allow the @short.product.name@ process to bind to the necessary ports will prevent
			this error from occurring.
		</para>

    <section id="known-issues-startup-timeout">
        <title>Timeout During Startup Due to Insufficient Resources</title>
        <para>
            The @short.product.name@ will fail to start correctly if it is running on slow hardware or
            on a system with insufficient resources. Typically this manifests as error <literal>KE0004E</literal> .
            Configuring the <link linkend="configuring-kernel-properties">startup wait limit</link> will provide the
            @short.product.name@ with more time for initialisation.
        </para>

	<section id="known-issues-perm-gen-sun-vm">
		<title>OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space running on Sun VM</title>
		<para>
			As a result of Sun Java bug
			<ulink url="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4957990">4957990</ulink>,
			the @product.name@ may consume more PermGen space than expected when running with the
			server HotSpot compiler. This problem may be resolved by configuring the
			<literal>JAVA_OPTS</literal> environment variable to specify an increased
			<literal>MaxPermSize</literal>, for example <literal>-XX:MaxPermSize=128M</literal>.

	<section id="alternate-serviceability-work">
		<title>Alternate <literal>serviceability</literal> and <literal>work</literal> Directories</title>
		<para>
			Although an alternate <literal>config</literal> directory may be specified on startup, there is no way to specify
			alternate <literal>serviceability</literal> or <literal>work</literal> directories. This is covered by
			<ulink url="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=307737">bug 307737</ulink> which also describes a workaround.

	<section id="web-application-context-configuration">
		<title>Web Application Context Configuration File Copying</title>
		<para>If a web application, packaged as an archive rather than a directory, includes context configuration in <literal>META-INF/context.xml</literal>,
		Virgo copies this file to <literal>$SERVER_HOME/config/[enginename]/[hostname]/[contextpath].xml</literal>.
		If the application is redeployed, the copy of the context configuration overrides any updated context configuration included in 
		<literal>META-INF/context.xml</literal>. To use the updated context configuration, the user must delete the copy of the file before redeploying.
		This is covered by
			<ulink url="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=328683">bug 328683</ulink>.

	<section id="windows-deletion">
		<title>Problem Deleting Installation Directory under Windows</title>
		<para>
			Sometimes Microsoft Windows won't let you delete the Web Server installation directory, typically because of long paths
			inside the <literal>work</literal> directory.
	 	</para>
		<para>
			You can return the Web Server server to a clean state by running the startup script with the options
			<literal>-clean -noStart</literal>, after which you should be able to delete the installation directory.
			See <link linkend="cleaning-without-starting">Cleaning  @product.name@ without Starting it</link> for more information.
