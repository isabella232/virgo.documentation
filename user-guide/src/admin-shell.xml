	<title>Equinox Console Extension</title>

	<para>Virgo provides an extension to the Equinox console that allows you to examine artifacts currently installed to a particular Web Server instance, manage the lifecycle of the installed artifacts, install new artifacts, and shutdown the server.   You can install, examine, and manage the lifecycle of the following artifacts:</para>

		<title>install Command</title>

		<para>Use the <literal>install</literal> command to deploy an artifact to Web Server.  The artifact can be a bundle, PAR, plan, or configuration artifact.</para>

		<para>The <literal>install</literal> command takes a single parameter: the URI of the artifact you want to deploy.  For example, to deploy a bundle on the local computer, use the <literal>file</literal> scheme:</para>

		<programlisting>file://full-pathname-to-artifact</programlisting>

		<para>After you execute the <literal>install</literal> command, Web Server attempts to resolve the artifact's dependencies, and if it is successful, puts it in the <literal>Resolved</literal> state.  At that point, you must start the artifact to be able to actually use it. </para>

		<para>The following example shows how to install a bundle called <literal>swf-booking-mvc.war</literal> located in the <literal>/home/apps</literal> directory of the computer on which the Equinox Console Extension is being run:</para>

		<programlisting>:> install file://home/apps/swf-booking-mvc.war

		<para>The following example shows how to use the <literal>bundle list</literal> command to ensure that the bundle was indeed installed to Web Server; if you had installed a different kind of artifact, for example a plan, then you would use the appropriate command (such as <literal>plan list</literal>):</para>
