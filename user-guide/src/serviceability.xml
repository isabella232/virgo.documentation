<para>
Logging (both event logging and trace logging) in @short.product.name@ comes in two forms: application logging and server logging.
Both are configured together in the <literal>serviceability.xml</literal> file in the <literal>config</literal> directory.
This takes the form of a Logback configurationâ€”@short.product.name@
uses a Logback implementation behind the SLF4J logging interface. 
</para>

<para>
What was previously referred to as <emphasis>Logging</emphasis>, is now referred to as <emphasis>Event Logging</emphasis>, 
and what was previously referred to as <emphasis>Trace logging</emphasis> (or <emphasis>Tracing</emphasis>) is now simply <emphasis>Logging</emphasis>.
</para>

    <section id="serviceability-info-log">
      <title>Event log files</title>
      <para>
        Event log files are low-volume logs of important events in @product.name@. Each server message written to
 		an event log file is accompanied by a code enclosed in angle brackets. 
 		An example is shown below:
<screen>
[2009-08-25 15:04:57.044] server-dm-7                  &lt;OF0001I&gt; OSGi telnet console available on port 2401.
</screen>
		(For a description of the log code syntax, see <xref linkend="log-codes"/>.)
        The format of event log messages from the server is fully configurable.
      </para>
      <para>
        By default, event log messages are stored in
        <literal>$SERVER_HOME/serviceability/eventlogs/eventlog_</literal><emphasis>i</emphasis><literal>.log</literal> and output to the console.
        The index <emphasis>i</emphasis> varies from 1 to 4, at 10Mb boundaries. An examination of the <emphasis>Logback</emphasis> configuration will
        show these defaults being set. They may be modified. 
      </para>
    <para>
    For a description of the syntax and facilities provided by this file
    see the <emphasis>Logback</emphasis> documentation (referenced in <xref linkend="furtherreading"/>).

    <section id="serviceability-info-trace">
      <title>Trace (Logging)</title>
      <para>
	    The @product.name@&rsquo;s logging (trace) support serves two main purposes:
	    <itemizedlist>
		  <listitem>
		    It provides global trace files that capture high-volume information regarding the @product.name@&rsquo;s internal events. 
		    The files are intended
		    for use by support personnel to diagnose runtime problems.  
	      </listitem>
	      <listitem>
		    It provides application trace files that contain application-generated output. 
		    This includes output generated using popular logging and
		    tracing APIs, as well as output generated by calls to <literal>System.out</literal> and <literal>System.err</literal>. 
		    These files are
		    intended for use by application developers and system administrators.
		  </listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
        </para>
        <para>
		    By default, the @short.product.name@ trace file is called 
		    <literal>$SERVER_HOME/serviceability/logs/virgo-server/log_</literal><emphasis>i</emphasis><literal>.log</literal>,
		    and, again by default, the application trace files are called 
		    <literal>$SERVER_HOME/serviceability/logs/</literal><emphasis>application_name</emphasis><literal>/log_</literal><emphasis>i</emphasis><literal>.log</literal>, 
            where <emphasis>application_name</emphasis> is automatically set by @short.product.name@ for each application artifact installed and run 
            (it is a combination of the artifact name and the version).
        </para>
        <para>The index <emphasis>i</emphasis> varies from 1 to 4, on a rolling basis, as each log file exceeds 10Mb.
      </para>
      <para>
		Entries in trace files are by default of the form &lt;timestamp&gt; &lt;thread-name&gt; &lt;source&gt; &lt;level&gt; &lt;entry-text&gt;. For example:
		<screen>
[2008-05-15 09:09:46.940] server-dm-2 org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Protocol I Initializing Coyote HTTP/1.1 on http-48080
	    </screen>
        although this format is completely determined by the Logback configuration file <literal>serviceability.xml</literal>.
      </para>
	  <section id="serviceability-info-trace-app">
		<title>Application Output</title>
		<para>
			@product.name@ provides advanced support for capturing and tracing application-generated output by automatically separating trace output on a
			per-application basis and will also capture any <literal>System.out</literal> and <literal>System.err</literal> output.
		</para>
		<section id="per-application-trace">
			<title>Per-application trace</title>
			<para>
				@product.name@ uses SLF4J interfaces to Logback, and the root logger (by default) captures all logging output
				and appends it to the application-specific trace files as described above.
				To modify this, define application-specific loggers in the <literal>serviceability.xml</literal> file in the normal way.
			</para>
        </section>
        <section id="sysout-and-syserr">
	      <title>System.out and System.err</title>
		  <para>
            <literal>System.out</literal> and <literal>System.err</literal> output from applications is, by default, captured in the
            application&rsquo;s trace file.
            This happens because the output streams are intercepted and written to the loggers named 
            <literal>System.out</literal> and <literal>System.err</literal> respectively.  
			Since there are no explicit loggers defined with these names in the <literal>serviceability.xml</literal> file, 
			this output is logged by the root logger (which captures <literal>INFO</literal> level and above).
          </para>
		  <para>
			The capture of <literal>System.out</literal> and <literal>System.err</literal> output is configured in the
			<literal>config/org.eclipse.virgo.medic.properties</literal> file by the <literal>log.wrapSysOut</literal> and 
			<literal>log.wrapSysErr</literal> properties. By default the properties have a value of <literal>true</literal>
			and capture is enabled. Capture can be disabled by configuring the properties with a value of <literal>false</literal>.
		  </para>
          <para>
            The trace entries for <literal>System.out</literal> and <literal>System.err</literal>
			output are of the form:
		    <screen>
[2008-05-16 09:28:45.874] server-tomcat-thread-1 System.out Hello world!
[2008-05-16 09:28:45.874] server-tomcat-thread-1 System.err Hello world!
			</screen>
			The third column indicates where the output came from (<literal>System.out</literal> or <literal>System.err</literal>).
		  </para>
		  <para>
		  To over-ride this behaviour, simply define explicit loggers named <literal>System.out</literal> 
		  and/or <literal>System.err</literal> in the configuration file to send this output to an appender of your choice.
		  Be aware that all applications&rsquo; output streams will be caught by these loggers, and that a sifting appender might be useful to separate them.

      <title>Service Dumps</title>
      <para>
        A service dump is triggered when one of the following events
        occurs:
      </para>
      <orderedlist numeration="arabic">
        <listitem>

          </para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>
        A service dump contains a snapshot of all the important state from
        the running @product.name@ instance. This snapshot is not intended
        for end user consumption but is useful for service personnel.
      </para>
      <para>
        By default, service dumps are created in
        <literal>$SERVER_HOME/serviceability/dump</literal>.
