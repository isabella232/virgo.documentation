== Starting and Stopping {tomcat-product-name}

Starting and Stopping {tomcat-product-name-short}

=== Starting {tomcat-product-name}

To start {tomcat-product-name} run the `startup.sh` (Linux) or `startup.bat` (Windows) script.
For both platforms, the script is located in the `SERVER_HOME/bin` directory.

[NOTE]
--
This chapter applies to {nano-product-name} too. Note that since {nano-product-name-short}
has a single region you can ignore the console output from the user region and focus on the instructions.
A successful startup of {nano-product-name-short} is as simple as that:
....
[2011-12-28 11:41:31.528] startup-tracker              <KE0001I> Kernel starting.
[2011-12-28 11:41:31.602] startup-tracker              <KE0002I> Kernel started.
....
--

==== Linux

To start {tomcat-product-name}, open a terminal window and run `startup.sh`:

....
$ cd $SERVER_HOME
$ bin/startup.sh</screen>
....

Once {tomcat-product-name} has started, the console will display a log message
similar to the one shown below, along with other status messages:

....
[2009-11-30 12:12:12.111] Thread-2   <UR0001I> User region ready.
....

The preceding message indicates that you can start using {tomcat-product-name-short}.

==== Microsoft Windows

To start {tomcat-product-name}, open a command-window and run `startup.bat`:

....
c:> cd %SERVER_HOME%
c:> bin\startup.bat</screen>
....

Once {tomcat-product-name} has started, the console will display a log message
similar to the one shown below, along with other status messages:

....
[2009-11-30 12:12:12.111] Thread-2   <UR0001I> User region ready.
....

The preceding message indicates that you can start using {tomcat-product-name-short}.

=== Starting in Clean Mode

When you start {tomcat-product-name} in clean mode, the startup script removes the `SERVER_HOME/work` directory (and hence all
running applications) as well as all trace, log and dump files.  It leaves the
`SERVER_HOME/repository` and `SERVER_HOME/pickup` directories untouched,
which means that any applications previously hot deployed will be automatically reinstalled.

==== Linux

To start {tomcat-product-name} in clean mode, open a terminal window and run `startup.sh -clean`:

....
$ cd $SERVER_HOME
$ bin/startup.sh -clean
....

==== Microsoft Windows

To start {tomcat-product-name} in clean mode, open a command window and run `startup.bat -clean`:

....
C:> cd %SERVER_HOME%
C:> bin\startup.bat -clean
....

=== Starting in Debug Mode

==== Linux

To start {tomcat-product-name} in debug mode, run
`startup.sh` passing in the
`-debug` argument:

....
$ cd $SERVER_HOME
$ bin/startup.sh -debug
....

This will start the debug agent listening on port
`8000` which is the default remote debug port used
by Eclipse. To start in debug mode with a specific port number, pass
this in as the value for the `-debug` argument:

....
$ cd $SERVER_HOME
$ bin/startup.sh -debug 8001
....

This will start the debug agent listening on port
`8001`. To start in debug mode and suspend the VM
until a debugger attaches, pass in the `-suspend`
argument along with the `-debug` argument:

....
$ cd $SERVER_HOME
$ bin/startup.sh -debug -suspend
....

This starts the debug agent, but prevents {tomcat-product-name} from actually
starting until a debugger attaches to the agent. This can be useful
when trying to diagnose problems that occur during startup.

==== Microsoft Windows

To start {tomcat-product-name} in debug mode, run
`startup.bat` passing in the
`-debug` argument:

....
C:> cd %SERVER_HOME%
C:> bin\startup.bat -debug
....

This will start the debug agent listening on port
`8000` which is the default remote debug port used
by Eclipse. To start in debug mode with a specific port number, pass
this in as the value for the `-debug` argument:

....
C:> cd %SERVER_HOME%
C:> bin\startup.bat -debug 8001
....

This will start the debug agent listening on port
`8001`. To start in debug mode and suspend the VM
until a debugger attaches, pass in the `-suspend`
argument along with the `-debug` argument:

....
C:> cd %SERVER_HOME%
C:> bin\startup.bat -debug -suspend
....

This starts the debug agent, but prevents {tomcat-product-name} from actually
starting until a debugger attaches to the agent. This can be useful
when trying to diagnose problems that occur during startup.

=== Starting with JMX Access Modifications

The {tomcat-product-name} always starts with JMX access enabled, allowing you to use a management tool such as JConsole
to attach to the Web Server instance.
By default both local access and remote access over SSL with username and password
authentication are provided. The default port for secure JMX access is `9875`
and the default username and password are `admin` and `springsource`.

==== Linux

To start {tomcat-product-name} with default JMX access enabled, run `startup.sh` passing
in no arguments:

....
$ cd $SERVER_HOME
$ bin/startup.sh
....

To start JConsole, run the `jconsole.sh` script, located in the `bin` directory, as shown:

....
$ cd $SERVER_HOME
$ bin/jconsole.sh
....

The following image shows how to specify a local connection using JConsole.

image:jmx-local-attach.png[]

The following image shows how to specify a remote connection in JConsole that uses SSL with the default
username/password (`admin/springsource` and default secure port of `9875`).

image:jmx-remote-attach-default.png[]

To start with the JMX remote access on a specific port number other than the default `9875`,
pass this port number in as the value
of the `-jmxport` argument:

....
$ cd $SERVER_HOME
$ bin/startup.sh -jmxport 9090
....

This will start the {tomcat-product-name} with JMX enabled for remote connections on port `9090`.

image:jmx-remote-attach-jmxport.png[]

To start the JMX remote access with a custom username and password, update the `$SERVER_HOME/configuration/org.eclipse.virgo.kernel.users.properties` file.  First specify the custom username by changing the value of the `role.admin` property.  Then set the password of this new user by adding a new property called `user.*username*`, where `*username*` refers to the actual name of the user.  Finally, restart {tomcat-product-name-short} for the changes to take effect.
 For example, if you want change the JMX remote access username to `zebedee` with password `florence`, change the file as follows:

[source,txt]
----
##################
# User definitions
##################
user.zebedee=florence


##################
# Role definitions
##################
role.admin=zebedee
----

Specify the custom username in JConsole as shown.

image:jmx-remote-attach-jmxusers.png[]

To start the JMX remote access using a custom SSL certificate, edit the file located at
`$SERVER_HOME/configuration/keystore`. If you wish to use a different keystore,
pass this filename in as the value for the `-keystore` argument and the keystore
password in as the value for the `-keystorePassword` argument:

....
$ cd $SERVER_HOME
$ bin/startup.sh -keystore customKeystore -keystorePassword customKeystorePassword
....

This will start the {tomcat-product-name} with JMX enabled for remote connections using an SSL certificate from
`customKeystore` with a password of `customKeystorePassword`.

==== Microsoft Windows

To start {tomcat-product-name} with default JMX access enabled, run `startup.bat` passing
in no arguments:

....
C:> cd %SERVER_HOME%
C:> bin\startup.bat
....

To start JConsole, run the `jconsole.bat` script, located in the `bin` directory, as shown:

....
C:> cd %SERVER_HOME%
C:> bin\jconsole.bat
....

The following image shows how to specify a local connection using JConsole.

image:jmx-local-attach.png[]

The following image shows how to specify a remote connection in JConsole that uses SSL with the default
username/password (`admin/springsource` and default secure port of `9875`).

image:jmx-remote-attach-default.png[]

To start with the JMX remote access on a specific port number other than the default `9875`,
pass this port number in as the value of the `-jmxport` argument:

....
C:> cd %SERVER_HOME%
C:> bin\startup.bat -jmxport 9090
....

This will start the {tomcat-product-name} with JMX enabled for remote connections on port
`9090`.

image:jmx-remote-attach-jmxport.png[]

To start the JMX remote access with a custom username and password, update the `%SERVER_HOME%\configuration\org.eclipse.virgo.kernel.users.properties` file.  First specify the custom username by changing the value of the `role.admin` property.  Then set the password of this new user by adding a new property called `user.*username*`, where `*username*` refers to the actual name of the user.  Finally, restart {tomcat-product-name-short} for the changes to take effect.
 For example, if you want change the JMX remote access username to `zebedee` with password `florence`, change the file as follows:

[source,txt]
----
##################
# User definitions
##################
user.zebedee=florence


##################
# Role definitions
##################
role.admin=zebedee
----

Specify the custom username in JConsole as shown.

image:jmx-remote-attach-jmxusers.png[]

To start the JMX remote access using a custom SSL certificate, edit the file located at
`%SERVER_HOME%\configuration\keystore`. If you wish to use a different
keystore, pass this filename in as the value for the `-keystore` argument and the
keystore password in as the value for the `-keystorePassword` argument:

....
C:> cd %SERVER_HOME%
C:> bin\startup.bat -keystore customKeystore -keystorePassword customKeystorePassword
....

This will start the {tomcat-product-name} with JMX enabled for remote attach using an SSL certificate from
`customKeystore` with a password of `customKeystorePassword`.

anchor:starting-stopping-configuration-directory[]

=== Starting with a Custom Configuration Directory

Use the `-configDir` option to specify an alternate `configuration` directory, different from the
default `SERVER_HOME/configuration` directory. This option allows you to use the same {tomcat-product-name}
installation to run multiple instances of {tomcat-product-name-short}. Simply create a configuration directory for each
instance, specify unique port numbers, logging and tracing directories, and so on, and then specify that directory
when starting {tomcat-product-name-short}.

If you specify a relative path for the `-configDir` parameter,
the startup script interprets the path as relative to the root of the {tomcat-product-name} installation,
and not relative to the directory from which you execute the `startup` script.

See xref:alternate-serviceability-work[Alternate `serviceability` and `work`
Directories] for a known issue related to specifying an alternate `configuration` directory.

==== Linux

To start {tomcat-product-name} using a configuration directory of `/configuration/node1`:

....
$ cd $SERVER_HOME
$ bin/startup.sh -configDir /configuration/node1
....

==== Windows

To start {tomcat-product-name} using a configuration directory of `c:\configuration\node1`:

....
C:> cd %SERVER_HOME%
C:> bin\startup.bat -configDir c:\configuration\node1
....

=== Stopping {tomcat-product-name}

==== Linux

To stop a running instance of {tomcat-product-name}, start a new terminal window and run the `shutdown.sh` script:

....
$ cd $SERVER_HOME
$ bin/shutdown.sh
....

To stop a running instance of {tomcat-product-name} immediately, bypassing normal shutdown
processing, run `shutdown.sh` with the `-immediate` option:

....
$ cd $SERVER_HOME
$ bin/shutdown.sh -immediate
....

If, when you started the Web Server instance, you used the `-jmxport` option to specify a non-default JMX port number,
then you must pass this port number to the `-jmxport` of the `shutdown.sh` script
to gracefully shut it down.
For example, if you specified `9090` as the JMX port, use the following to shut down the Web Server instance:

....
$ cd $SERVER_HOME
$ bin/shutdown.sh -jmxport 9090
....

==== Microsoft Windows

To stop a running instance of {tomcat-product-name}, start a new console window and run the `shutdown.bat` script:

....
C:> cd %SERVER_HOME%
C:> bin\shutdown.bat
....

To stop a running instance of {tomcat-product-name} immediately, bypassing normal shutdown
processing, run `shutdown.bat` with the `-immediate` option:

....
C:> cd %SERVER_HOME%
C:> bin\shutdown.bat -immediate
....

If, when you started the Web Server instance, you used the `-jmxport` option to specify a non-default JMX port number,
then you must pass this port number to the `-jmxport` of the `shutdown.bat` script to gracefully shut it down.
For example, if you specified `9090` as the JMX port, use the following to shut down the Web Server instance:

....
C:> cd %SERVER_HOME%
C:> bin\shutdown.bat -jmxport 9090
....

anchor:cleaning-without-starting[]

=== Cleaning  {tomcat-product-name} without Starting it

When you clean {tomcat-product-name}, the startup script removes the `SERVER_HOME/work` directory (and hence all
running applications) as well as all trace, log and dump files.  It leaves the
`SERVER_HOME/repository` and `SERVER_HOME/pickup` directories untouched,
which means that any applications previously hot deployed will be automatically reinstalled next time the Web Server is started.

Cleaning is useful when you want to start the Web Server from a clean state next time, but you don't want to start the Web Server yet.

Cleaning is also useful for tidying up the directory structure. For example, sometimes Microsoft Windows won't let you delete the Web
Server installation directory.
See xref:windows-deletion[Problem Deleting Installation Directory under Windows] for more details.

==== Linux

To clean {tomcat-product-name}, open a terminal window and run `startup.sh -clean -noStart`:

....
$ cd $SERVER_HOME
$ bin/startup.sh -clean -noStart
....

==== Microsoft Windows

To clean {tomcat-product-name}, open a command window and run `startup.bat -clean -noStart`:

....
C:> cd %SERVER_HOME%
C:> bin\startup.bat -clean -noStart
....

anchor:equinox-launcher[]

=== Using Equinox Launcher

Since version 3.5 {project-name} uses the standard Equinox Launcher as its default launcher.
As a result in addition to all the launcher options described so far users can also pass arguments specific to the Equinox launcher.

[IMPORTANT]
--
The Equinox Launcher arguments must be placed at the end of the startup call. Here's an example
....
$ ./startup.sh "virgo-args" "equinox-launcher-args"
$ ./startup.sh -clean -console 2222</screen>
....
--

A full list of the accepted Equinox Launcher arguments is available at http://help.eclipse.org/[help.eclipse.org].
