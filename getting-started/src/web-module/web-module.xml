		<para>
    	In common with most Enterprise Java applications @greenpages@ uses a web-based interface for user interactions.
		The following steps show how the controller for the application is constructed,
		using a service from the OSGi Service Registry.
		</para>
    <para>
    It is assumed that the instructions in <xref linkend="installation"/> have been followed already 
    and that the @greenpages@
    zip file has been downloaded and unzipped as described in <xref linkend="installing.greenpages"/>.
 <!-- 
    The working solution projects should be installed into @sts.short@, 
    as described in <xref linkend="installing.greenpages.tools"/>.

    </para>
<!-- 
<para>
    The completed application (in directory <literal>$GREENPAGES_HOME/solution</literal>) is examined; the skeleton (in directory <literal>$GREENPAGES_HOME/start</literal>)
    can be used to build the application by following the same sequence and supplying the missing pieces.
