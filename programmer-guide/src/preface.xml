	<para>
		Increasing complexity in modern enterprise applications is a fact of life.
		You not only have to deal with complex business logic, but also a myriad
		of other concerns such as security, auditing, exposing business
		functionality to external applications, and managing the evolution of
		that functionality and technologies. The Spring Framework and Spring
		Portfolio products address these needs by offering a Plain-Old Java Object
		(POJO) based solution that lets you focus on your business logic.

	<para>
		Complex applications pose problems that go beyond using the right set of
		technologies. You need to take into account other considerations such as
		a simplified development process, easy deployment, monitoring deployed
		applications, and managing changes in response to changing business needs.
		This is where the @umbrella.product.name@ comes into play. It offers a simple yet
		comprehensive platform to develop, deploy, and service enterprise
		applications. In this Programmer Guide, we explore the runtime portions of the
		@umbrella.product.name@, the @product.name@ and the @kernel.product.name@, and learn how to develop
		applications to benefit from their capabilities.

		<title>A Note to @kernel.product.name@ Programmers</title>
		<para>
			Although this guide is written primarily for @product.name@ programmers, much of it is also useful for
			@kernel.product.name@ programmers who should simply ignore the web-related sections.
